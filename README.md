###Non-Profit Abnonamility Test

####Introduction


####Inspiration
The inspiration for this assessment was the recent release of Non-Profit Financial Data by the IRS.

In June 2016 at the request of congress the IRS released parsable XML files for every nonprofit organization that files a form 990 on Amazon Web Services.

A form 990 is the form that every non-profit organization is required to file in order to maintain its non-profit status it includes extensive amount of  information on non-profits Assets, Liabilities, Revenues, and Expenses.  It also includes information such as expenses on indoor tanning if your interested.

See the first link below for an example of the form 990 non profits file, second link for an example of the 990 XML files available, and the third link for information for how to pull the files off AWS.
