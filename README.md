###Non-Profit Abnonamility Test

The purpose of this project is to evaluate non-profit information and identify non-profit organizations that behave abnormally from others according to a few select select financial engineered metrics.  See the following steps and procedures performed.

Step 2: Based on research on non-profit organization create a list of financial metrics to analyze of non-profit organizations and create a new data set with the sample data set and the financial metrics as parameters.  See list of Financial Metrics in the link below as well as the feature engineered data set presented.

Step 3: Perform EDA analysis of the feature engineered data set below.

Step 4: Perform a anomailty test on the sample data set and seperate outling organizations.

Step 5: Perform EDA analysis on on the outling organizations sample.

Step 6: Reperform anomality test until seen fit.

Step 7: Create anomaility population of all types using Amazon Web Services.

Step 8: Perform EDA Procedures

Step 9: Create visualization and make inferences of the abnormal populations.
